Authors: Yinan Shu, Donald G. Truhlar
        University of Minnesota
Version: 1.0
         Updated on Feb 14, 2025
  
Features of current version
    Available coordinate files:
        general, xyz, canonical_xyz
    Available network architecture: 
        feed-forward neural network
        message-passing neural network
    Available molecular representation:
        xyz, zmatrix, distance
        permutation invaraint polynomials (PIPs) of distances,
        graph
    Available methods:
        diabatization by deep neural network (DDNN)
        compatibilization by deep neural network (CDNN)
            with controllable matrix form
  
    physical properties:
        1. using permutation invariant molecular representation or
           a permuted database to constrain or restrain permutation symmetry
        2. using parametrically managed activation function to enforce
           correct behavior of potential energy surfaces (PESs) in asymptotic
           and/or repulsive regions

Using User defined general representation.
Warning: permutation is required to be constrained,
                     molecular representation can currently ONLY be pip or graph,
                     change molecular representation to permutation invariant polynomials
                     of distances.

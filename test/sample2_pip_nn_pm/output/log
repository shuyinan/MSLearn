Authors: Yinan Shu, Donald G. Truhlar
        University of Minnesota
Version: 1.0
         Updated on Feb 14, 2025
  
Features of current version
    Available coordinate files:
        general, xyz, canonical_xyz
    Available network architecture: 
        feed-forward neural network
        message-passing neural network
    Available molecular representation:
        xyz, zmatrix, distance
        permutation invaraint polynomials (PIPs) of distances,
        graph
    Available methods:
        diabatization by deep neural network (DDNN)
        compatibilization by deep neural network (CDNN)
            with controllable matrix form
  
    physical properties:
        1. using permutation invariant molecular representation or
           a permuted database to constrain or restrain permutation symmetry
        2. using parametrically managed activation function to enforce
           correct behavior of potential energy surfaces (PESs) in asymptotic
           and/or repulsive regions

Start validating keywords and checking potential conflict
Warning: permutation is required to be constrained,
                     molecular representation can currently ONLY be pip or graph,
                     change molecular representation to permutation invariant polynomials
                     of distances.
input feature automatically detected as 24
output target automatically detected as 3
edge feature automatically detected as 0
the currently only supported base_potential_type is atom+diatom
Warning:parametrically managed activation function's smooth boxcar function parameters
                     was not set up, we use a reasonable guess of it by setting it to -1.0, 4.0, 2.0
